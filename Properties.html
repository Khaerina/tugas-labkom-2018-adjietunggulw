<h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
Hexan-2-one is colourless liquid <br>
<b>uses :</b> 2-Hexanone is used in various organic chemical syntheses. It is used in the synthesis of (+/-)-monomorine. It is also used in the preparation of alcohols by transfer hydrogenation of ketones.
<b>General Description : </b>
A clear colorless liquid. Flash point 95°F. Less dense than water. Vapors heavier than air. <br>
<b>Air & Water Reactions :</b>Highly flammable. Slightly soluble in water. <br>
<b>Reactivity Profile:</b> 2-Hexanone is incompatible with oxidizing agents. 2-Hexanone may also react with strong bases and reducing agents. <br>
<b>Health Hazard :</b>
Inhalation of high concentrations of vapor may result in narcosis; peripheral neuropathy may develop. Ingestion of large amounts may cause some systemic injury. Contact with eyes causes mild to moderate irritation. Liquid irritates skin; prolonged or repeated contact may cause defatting of the skin with resultant dermatitis. <br>
<b>Fire Hazard : </b>2-Hexanone is flammable. <br>
